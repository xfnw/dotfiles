Hi son how r u doing? Hope everything is working well 4u down there. I have been wanting 2 tell u whenever u get d chance to go see d Urologist Dr. Urologist Dr is specializing on mens only reproductive organs meaning ur Penas or ur dick. A lot of times some mens has blockage problems, that's whaat causes d Erectile dysfunction. Remember Auntie Kum n Uncle Dennis in Colorado their son Dennis Jr has Erectile dysfunction at young age n d Dr did d surgery on him n removed d blockage so d blood can flow freely on his penas he's normal after that n have an erection, honey u can still b gay/trans n have an erection at d same time. Ur still young n have a long life ahead of u n plenty of time 2 recover. U have 2 fight 4 ur self,give ur self a chance n u owe that 2 ur self as well, don't settle 4 less honey u deserve better n can do better, pls don't shut d door on ur self have 2 have an open mind n b strong. Ur dad had Erectile dysfuction when I met him they did d surgery on ur dad n removed d blockage he ws fine n u came along... we love u son we just want u 2 b HAPPY n live life. We miss u, please take care of ur self n God Bless u always. Bcareful n b safe out there.
